Test Yourself: Selectors Five

In this final task add CSS using attribute selectors to do the following:

1. Target the <a> element with a title attribute and make the border pink (border-color: pink).
2. Target the <a> element with an href attribute that contains the word contact somewhere in its value and make the border orange (border-color: orange).
3. Target the <a> element with an href value starting with https and give it a green border (border-color: green).
